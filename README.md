# 🤠 ROOOOOOO! Welcome to Jett's Beans, Y'all! 🫘

Well butter my biscuit and call me a beanpole! You've stumbled upon the finest, most toe-tappin', knee-slappin' bean orderin' website this side of the Mississippi!

## 🎸 What in Tarnation is This?

This here's **Jett's Beans** - a React application slicker than a greased pig at the county fair! We're servin' up the best dang beans you ever did see, from Black Beans to our special **ROO BEANS** (that's right, we said ROOO 🦘).

## 🌾 Features That'll Knock Your Boots Off

- **Home Page** - Prettier than a peach, with Jett himself cookin' up a storm in the background
- **About Page** - The whole dang story about how Jett got into the bean business (spoiler: it involves his meemaw)
- **Order Page** - Pick your beans, throw 'em in the cart, and holler "YEEHAW!" when you submit

### The Bean Lineup (Hotter Than a Jalapeño in July!)

1. **Black Beans** - Dark as a moonless night on the ranch
2. **Pinto Beans** - Classic as mama's Sunday dinner
3. **Navy Beans** - Small but mighty, like a bantam rooster
4. **Roo Beans** - ROOOOO! 🦘 (Imported straight from down under, partner)
5. **JETT'S SPECIAL COMBO** - Holy smokes, this'll put hair on your chest!

## 🚀 Gettin' This Puppy Runnin'

Well now, listen up good 'cause I'm only gonna tell ya once:

### Step 1: Wrangle Them Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
*(That's like roundin' up cattle, but for code)*

### Step 2: Fire Up the Grill
```bash
npm run dev
```
*(Hotter than a two-dollar pistol!)*

### Step 3: Mosey On Over To
```
http://localhost:5173
```
*(That's where the magic happens, friend)*

## 🤔 Troubleshootin' (When Things Go Cattywampus)

**Server won't start?**
- Well shoot, check if Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Make sure you're in the right directory (don't be lost like a goose in a hailstorm)

**Tailwind actin' up?**
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again (sometimes you gotta start fresh, like plantin' new crops)

**Port already in use?**
- Try: `npm run dev -- --port 3000` (ain't no shame in usin' a different port)

## 🎉 Special Thanks

- To **Jett Rodriguez** for havin' the gumption to start this bean empire
- To **Meemaw Rodriguez** for them secret family recipes
- To **YOU** for takin' the time to read this here README (you're sweeter than sweet tea on a hot day!)
